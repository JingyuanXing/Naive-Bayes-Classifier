2.1 When our test set only contains 18 speeches, the evaluation result may be influenced by the unbalanced classes problem. To be specific, for example, we may have too many BLUE speeches in our test set, and only a few RED speeches in the test set. xxx how to change? xxx draw back?


2.2 Yes, some predictions are more certain than others. This is because we make our prediction by comparing the log probability of RED and BLUE, and choose the one with greater probability as our predicted class. If the two probabilities are very close to each other, then we are not very certain about our choice; on the other hand, if the difference between the two probabilities is large, then we will be pretty certain about our choice. For those classifications that are wrong, I examined the probabilities of RED and BLUE, they are actually really really close, which definitely indicate relatively low confidence.
